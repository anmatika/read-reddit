The Raspi probably uses no more than 4 watts at max load usually none of the tasks will really ever be intensive tbh. Overall I wouldn't expect this to use any more energy than a cheap LED lightbulb. The most efficient setups wouldn't even use more than 6 watt tops~",

      "comment": "I had been aware of bitcoin since 2011, but after looking into the Silk Road decided it was to sketch to buy DMT and send it through the mail. So I backed out. The friend I had talked with about bitcoin came up to me at the bar in 2013 when bitcoin hit its then ATH. I stared into my phone the rest of the night despondent, reading article after article thinking I had missed out on a once in a lifetime opportunity to be rich. Fast forward to Christmas 2014 I left a casino after a drunken night of blackjack with $5,000. I still felt like gambling but knew from experience that I was likely to give it all back if I kept going. I checked bitcoin and saw it was close to a 52 week low. My though process was basically hey this seems cheap in comparison to when it was $1,200 so I bought 22 coins for 5k. I had lost all my savings in college by day trading the stock market and was determined not to make the same mistake so I started reading as much as I could about bitcoin. Once I fell down the rabbit hole I became convinced that bitcoin was the financial black swan I had been waiting for and I started piling more of the money from my job into weekly buys. Basically bought all through 2015 when the price was low, no special thought process. I‚Äôve paid $185 for a bitcoin and I‚Äôve paid $16,000 for a bitcoin. I literally have no fucking idea when is a good time to sell and when is a good time to buy. I just buy and hodl. I wish I had started buying sooner, but I‚Äôll tell you this I didn‚Äôt buy much in 17 or 18 but I‚Äôm back to buying heavily now.",

Only one friend actually kept his. I learned how simple minded and careless people can be.

They will most likely reject it since the chairman mention price manipulation and no custody in a recent speech on Nov 27. It takes time to change one's perspective and 3 month is not enough to do so. Im expecting price to bottom out around 2K-2.5K by Feb or Mar 2019 and then rally towards 6K by end of 2019. An ETF will be finally be approved in 2020 after Nasdaq and Bakkt are in operation for some time to convince an ETF is needed and then can BTC retest 20K.",
